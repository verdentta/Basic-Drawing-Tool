# First-Java-Application-
First Java Application that was made during first year computer science. The assignment was to create a simple drawing board.

If you have Java SE Development Kit already installed on your computer then you can just run the jar file and the application should work fine.
Otherwise, use eclipse to compile all the files and run.
